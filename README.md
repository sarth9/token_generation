# Exception Handling Smart Contract

A simple smart contract example demonstrating the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements in Solidity.

## Description

This project showcases a basic smart contract written in Solidity for handling exceptions. The contract includes functions to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds while utilizing different exception handling mechanisms to ensure the contract's integrity and security.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository

Ensure you have a Solidity development environment set up. You can use Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/) or any other local development setup.
Executing Program
1.Open the ExceptionHandling.sol file in your Solidity development environment.

2.Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.

3.Deploy the contract to a local or test Ethereum network.

4.Interact with the contract functions:

Deposit Funds:

ExceptionHandling.deposit(10);

Withdraw Funds:

ExceptionHandling.withdraw(5);

Transfer Funds:

ExceptionHandling.transfer(10, 0xRecipientAddress);
